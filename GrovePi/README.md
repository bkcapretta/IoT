Grove Pi
----------------------
**What is the GrovePi?**
- Add-on to the Raspberry Pi
- Over 100+ sensors
        - Ex: button, buzzer, ultrasonic sensor, rotary angle sensor, etc 
- Collects information from the outside environment 
        - Temperature, humidity, sound levels, light intensity, etc
- Easy to program in python 
        - Advertised as a Plug-n-Play product from dexter -> easy for kids to use

**What have I been working on with the GrovePi?**
- Attempting to parallel what Juliana did on the Ev3 on the GrovePi: https://github.com/CEEO-DrEsLab/IoT/tree/master/EV3
- Worked on introducing sensors to the Internet (ex: Twitter) and giving physical devices an online presence
        - Examples: https://youtu.be/KWlcQqoKCoU

**What does it prove? Why is it relevant and useful?**
- Sensors get info from environment and can put that info onto the Internet
- We’ve been able to indirectly prove that you can make the GrovePi communicate with the EV3
        - If the GrovePi sensors could connect to another device, it could provide a plethora of new inputs to that device
        - Adds a wealth of information in Sensors
- Augments the abilities of a Raspberry Pi
        - Raspberry Pi already can connect to internet; but with the GrovePi attached, the Raspberry Pi gets all of this information about the physical world from the sensors. 
- Users are no longer limited to just the sensors in their kit

**Getting Started with the Grove Pi?**

If you are just starting with the GrovePi, here is a step-by-step process to get your GrovePi up and running. 

        1. Attach GrovePi on top of Raspberry Pi - should fit nice and snug.
        
        2. Insert SD card into Raspberry Pi and make sure it clicks
        
        3. Connect a power supply to the Raspberry Pi in the micro USB slot. Two amps is a good amount to start. If you’re not supplying enough energy, you may see problems with your network. If everything is happening successfully, you should see the power light on the side that is solid red with a blinking green, ACT light next to it.
       
        4. Insert ethernet cable into the ethernet port on the Raspberry Pi and plug in the other end to your computer* (or to an external ethernet port). If everything is working well, the two ethernet lights (yellow and green) should appear.
        
        5. You can ssh into your pi on your own computer OR setup a display monitor with keyboard and mouse to continue. *If you don’t have an ethernet port on your own computer, start with a display monitor, keyboard, and mouse.
        
        6. You should see your monitor go through some initial downloads for Raspbian once all connected.
        
        7. Logging onto wifi: click on Wifi Setup on the top left hand corner. Attach a Wifi device to your Raspberry Pi. The space for Adapter in the Setup window should be blank before attaching the wifi dongle; but once in, the adapter name will pop up.
        
        8. Go to Manage Networks tab. Hit Scan. A dialog box of all the available wifi networks will open. Select your desired network. The SSID should be the name of the wifi network. Authentication should be WPA2-Personal(PSK). 
        
        9. Enter your wifi’s password in the PSK space. If no password, leave it blank. Press Add and then Close the scan results. Your desired network should now be listed on the current page.
        
        10. Go to the Current Status tab and the information should automatically fill in. The IP address should take a few seconds to load. Seeing the IP address means you have finally connected over your wifi network. 
        
        11. If the IP address does not appear, you have not connected. Go back to Manage Networks, open up your wifi network and click Edit. Try entering your PSK (password) again. 
        
        12. Now you should be able to successfully ssh onto your own computer! Simply type: ssh pi@IPaddress (for example ssh pi@123.45.67.890)
        
        13. If you’re using Dexter Industry products, know the default username and password:
                - username: pi
                - password: robots1234
                
        14. To confirm that you are connected to wifi, type: ping google.com If you are getting an IP address back, that means it is a successful ping. Press ctrl+c to exit 

Here’s a little video if you’d like to see a full walk-through, step by step:

**Change your password if it is still the default password!**

When logged in as the pi user, you can change your password with the passwd command. Enter **passwd** on the command line and hit Enter. You’ll be prompted to enter your current password to authenticate, and then asked for a new password. Hit Enter on completion and you’ll be asked to confirm it. Note that no characters will be displayed while entering your password. Once correctly confirmed, you’ll see a success message and the new password will be in effect immediately.

**Using a used Raspberry Pi and SD card? **

Here is a SD Formatter for Mac Download (If you need to reformat your SD card) 
- https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/eula_mac/
- *Warning* - Reformatting will erase everything on your SD card, so make sure to save any important files.

**How to get the Raspberry Pi software to communicate with the GrovePi**

The next step is to get the GrovePi communicating with the Raspberry Pi. 

        1. Make sure the Raspberry Pi is powered on. Without the GrovePi attached, open a terminal (can SSH on your computer or use terminal on a monitor).
        
        2. Change directories to the Desktop. It is recommended to install the GrovePi software on the Raspberry Pi Desktop. Clone the GrovePi git repository by using the command: 
            - cd /home/pi/Desktop
            - sudo git clone https://github.com/DexterInd/GrovePi
            
        3. When done downloading, there should be a new folder on the Desktop called GrovePi
        
        4. Go to the Scripts folder in the GrovePi folder.
            - cd /home/pi/Desktop/GrovePi/Script
            
        5. Make the install.sh bash script executable. Modify the permissions of the script by entering the following line into the terminal:
            - sudo chmod +x install.sh
            
        6. If you type ls -l (that’s two lowercase L’s), the install.sh should now be green. That means it was successfully changed to executable!
        
        7. Now you can start the script. You must be the root user, so make sure to use “sudo”.
            - sudo ./install.sh
            
        8. Press Enter when prompted. The script will download packages which are used by the GrovePi. Press y when the terminal prompts and asks for permission to start the download.
        
        9. The Raspberry Pi will automatically restart when the installation is complete. You can stop the reboot process anytime by pressing ctrl+c anytime. However, you must reboot for the update and installation to take effect.
        
        10. Now when the Raspberry Pi is powered down, stack the GrovePi on top. Ensure that the pins are properly connected before powering the Raspberry Pi.
        
        11. Power on the Raspberry Pi. A green light should power up on the GrovePi.
        
        12. To check that the script was correctly installed, check that the Raspberry Pi is able to detect the GrovePi by running the following line on the terminal
            - sudo i2cdetect -y 1
            - *Note:* If you have an original raspberry pi (sold before October 2012), the I2C is port 0: sudo i2cdetect -y 0
            
        13. If you can see a “04” in the output, this means the Raspberry Pi is able to detect the GrovePi.
        14. To test the GrovePi, connect a Grove LED to port D4 and run the blink example. In the terminal type:
            - cd /home/pi/Desktop/GrovePi/Software/Python
            - sudo python grove_led_blink.py
            
        If everything is installed correctly and the LED is on the port labeled D4, the LED should start blinking!

**Understanding the Grove Ports:**

The GrovePi is stacked on top of the Raspberry Pi without the need for any other connections. Communication between the two occurs over the I2C interface. All Grove modules connect to the universal Grove connectors on the GrovePi shield via the universal 4 pin connector cable.

Grove modules, which work on analog and digital signals, connect directly to the ATMEGA328 microcontroller on the Grove Pi.  The microcontroller acts as an interpreter between the Raspberry Pi and the Grove sensors.  It sends, receives, and executes commands sent by the RaspberryPi.

In addition, the GrovePi allows the Raspberry Pi to access some Grove sensors directly.  The Raspberry Pi has an I2C Bus and a Serial bus.  These buses can directly connect to sensors via the I2C Ports and the USART Port.

**I2C Ports** 

Directly accessible from Raspberry Pi or data can be interpreted by GrovePi and sent to Raspberry Pi
- For sensors like Grove Accelerometer or OLED

**Analog Ports**

Accessible from the Raspberry Pi by sending commands to the GrovePi
- For reading analog data from sensors like Grove Temperature Sensor

**Digital Ports**

Accessible from the Raspberry Pi by sending commands to the GrovePi
- For digital input and output, can be used for switches or sensors like Ultrasonic Ranger

**Raspberry Pi Serial**

Grove Serial modules can be directly connected and used by the Raspberry Pi
- For serial I/O to the Raspberry Pi

**GrovePi Serial**

Not connected to the Raspberry Pi directly
- For serial I/O to the GrovePi. Grove Serial modules can be connected, its data interpreted and sent to the RaspberryPi

Projects
-------------
**Raspberry Pi Projects for the Grove Pi Sensors:**

There are many good examples using all of the sensors, including: LED blink, LED Fade, Tilt Buzzer, Home Weather Display, Sensor Twitter Feed, Who’s at the Door, Open Wifi Finder, and more obscure projects. 
- Find them all here: http://www.dexterindustries.com/GrovePi/projects-for-the-raspberry-pi/

A good example, the Sensor Twitter Feed, reads the current temperature, light, and sound and instantly prints it out as a tweet. Check out this tutorial on how to send a tweet from a python script (uses tweepy import [Dexter tutorial uses twitter import which doesn’t work as well]): 
- http://nodotcom.org/python-twitter-tutorial.html

You could try the opposite of this project and start with the web: Twitterverse. Turn on an LED every time it detects a specific hashtag posted on Twitter. Check out this website for further information:
